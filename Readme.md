## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Babita00/backend-series.git
   cd backend-series
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. Example:

   ```
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdbname
   JWT_SECRET=yourjwtsecret
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Core Concepts

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express.js:** Minimalist web framework for Node.js.

## API Endpoints

### Example Routes

- **GET /api/v1/resource:** Fetch all resources
- **POST /api/v1/resource:** Create a new resource
- **GET /api/v1/resource/:id:** Fetch a single resource by ID
- **PUT /api/v1/resource/:id:** Update a resource by ID
- **DELETE /api/v1/resource/:id:** Delete a resource by ID

## Middleware

Custom middleware examples include request logging, authentication checks, and more.

## Error Handling

Standard error handling practices and custom error handlers.

## Database Integration

Connecting to databases like MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL using appropriate ORM/ODM libraries.

## Authentication and Authorization

Implementing JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.

## Testing

Using frameworks like Mocha, Chai, and Supertest for unit and integration testing.

## Deployment

Guidelines for deploying the application to platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request for any improvements or bug fixes.
